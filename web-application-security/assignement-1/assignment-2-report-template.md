# Report Template
---

I am thinking about trying to use Markdown for a report writing, it is quite easy to make a report in Gitbook.

Adding pictures and tables is also very easy.

I have used gitbook to create a guide at my previous work-place, which we then made into a website where you have a menu on the left side as it looks in gitbook and you can click it to move from page to page.
