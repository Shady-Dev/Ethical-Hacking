# The Threat Landscape

---

Based on 2017, the top-10:

1. Injection <br>
I have some experience with SQL injection on a test website, and I know how it works and why. Although I don't feel like I have any real experience with a real life scenarios. 

2. Broken Authentication <br>
We've tried this on some course previously, but not really an expert in this field. I may know in theory how to do this, but need further experience .

3. Sensitive Data Exposure <br>
Absolutely no clue. 

4. External Entities \(XXE\) <br>
Also no clue.

5. Broken Access Control <br>
This is quite big topic inside many companies. In my previous workplace we were talking about this a lot and were thinking about the Access restrictions and such. 

6. Security Misconfiguration <br>
Same as previous. Although this is quite broad topic. And in many cases this requires some coding skills, especially if the system is fully made by the company itself and is not bought as an external service. 

7. Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) <br>
No clue.

8. Insecure Deserialization <br>
Remote code execution is a familiar thing, but this method is not really. 

9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities <br>
I know that this is possible, but have no experience with these attack vectors. 

10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring <br>
With GDPR this is quite a huge topic as well. More logging, more secure logging. Restricted logging... And so on. We have to think about the security from an administrative point of view, which basically means that all changes in the system should be logged in a way that even administrators can't delete the logs later.
