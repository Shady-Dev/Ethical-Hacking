# The Threat Landscape

---

Based on 2017, the top-10:

1. Injection <br>
I have some experience with SQL injection on a test website, and I know how it works and why. Although I don't feel like I have any real experience with a real life scenarios. 

2. Broken Authentication <br>
We've tried this on some course previously, but not really an expert in this field. I may know in theory how to do this, but need further experience .

3. Sensitive Data Exposure <br>
Absolutely no clue. 

4. External Entities \(XXE\) <br>
Also no clue.

5. Broken Access Control <br>
This is quite big topic inside many companies. In my previous workplace we were talking about this a lot and were thinking about the Access restrictions and such. 

6. Security Misconfiguration <br>


7. Cross-Site Scripting \(XSS\) <br>


8. Insecure Deserialization <br>


9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities <br>


10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring <br>
